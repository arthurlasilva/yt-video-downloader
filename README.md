# yt-video-downloader
A simple Python script using the PyTube library that takes any YouTube link and downloads it at the highest quality, and also implemented a UI utilizing PySimpleGUI 
for a better visualization - making the tool a bit easier to use. I've also created an executable file using PyInstaller.

I plan on expanding on this ideia by having multiple simultaneous downloads and an animated progress bar.
As of now, when you click download the program seems to be stuck, but don't worry, it is fetching the file for you, so be patient!

Please enjoy! :)
