# yt-video-downloader
A simple Python script that takes any YouTube link and downloads it at the highest quality, and also implemented a UI utilizing PySimpleGUI 
for a better visualization - making the tool a bit easier to use.

I plan on expanding on this ideia by having multiple simultaneous downloads and an animated progress bar.

Please enjoy! :)
